# Gozem - Africa's Super App

**Gozem** is Africa's #1 super app. We launched it in 2018 in Togo with the conviction of bringing world-class digital services to underserved populations in West and Central Africa, starting with the transport/mobility sector.

Today, we offer a variety of transportation services on our platform, including motorcycle cabs, car cabs and tricycle cabs, as well as grocery delivery, meals, and other offerings. The range of services available on the Gozem platform will continue to expand in the future, in line with our customers' needs.

We are recruiting a front-end web developer that will have an integration meeting if he succeeds the technical test.
